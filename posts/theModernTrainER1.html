                with the designation RABe 511, of which 37 six-car trains are used in the suburban trains around Zurich
                and the rest in regional trains throughout Switzerland. The trains have a top speed of 160 km/h and have
                120 + 415 and 60 + 277 seats (first and second class, respectively).
                <br>
                <br>
                BLS (Switzerland)<br>
                Swiss operator BLS has 31 four-car trains, designated RABe 515, which are used for Bern's suburban
                trains. The trains have 335 seats in both first and second class, and can accommodate up to 556 standing
                passengers. The trains are locally known as MUTZ, an acronym for "Moderner, Universeller TriebZug"
                (modern, universal motor coach).

                <br>
                WESTbahn (Austria)<br>
                Operator WESTbahn acquired 17 train sets between 2011 and 2017 for fast service between Vienna and
                Salzburg. They were sold to German railway company Deutsche Bahn in 2019.

                <br>
                CFL (Luxembourg)<br>
                In October 2010, Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL) ordered eight three-car trains worth 60 million
                euros. The trains are 80 meters long and have 284 seats, including 29 in first class, as well as
                flexible spaces for up to 24 bicycles and three wheelchairs. To be able to operate in neighboring
                countries, the trains are equipped with ETCS and can run on both 25 kV 50 Hz and 15 kV 16.7 Hz
                alternating current. In December 2014, they were put into service on the Luxembourg-Koblenz route, and
                in March 2015, the government of Luxembourg decided to buy eleven more trains of the same type.
